# Google-Analytics

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of Google Analytics (GA) and Google Tag Manager (GTM) tracking for an e-commerce platform. The goal is to track user behavior, measure conversion funnels, optimize checkout processes, and provide deep insights into customer journeys.

Key Objectives
User Journey Mapping: Analyze customer interactions from landing to checkout.
E-Commerce Event Tracking: Monitor product views, add-to-cart, checkout, and purchase steps.
GTM Tag Configuration: Set up event-based triggers for accurate tracking.
Technical Documentation: Provide a structured dataLayer implementation, GTM setup, and integration details.
Automated Reporting & Insights: Leverage Google Analytics 4 (GA4), Google Tag Manager, and Power BI/Tableau for real-time analytics.
Tracking Scope & Implementation
1. Google Tag Manager (GTM) Setup
The Google Tag Manager (GTM) container is used to manage and deploy tracking scripts dynamically without modifying the site's core codebase.

GTM Container Structure:
GTM tags for GA4 events and enhanced e-commerce tracking.
Custom JavaScript variables to extract user & product data.
Event-based triggers to capture interactions.
GTM Tag Configuration
Tag Name	Event Name (GA4)	Trigger	Purpose
Page View	page_view	All pages	Tracks page loads
View Product	view_item	Product pages	Tracks product detail page views
Add to Cart	add_to_cart	Add-to-cart button	Captures items added to cart
Remove from Cart	remove_from_cart	Remove button	Captures items removed from cart
Begin Checkout	begin_checkout	Checkout page load	Tracks checkout process initiation
Purchase	purchase	Order Confirmation	Tracks successful purchases
2. User Journey Mapping
A structured customer journey analysis helps understand user behavior and optimize conversion rates. The MappingSample.xlsx document contains details on:

User Funnel Steps
Landing Page Visit → How users arrive (organic, paid, direct, referral)
Product Browsing → Pages viewed, product filtering, wishlist activity
Cart Interactions → Items added/removed, cart abandonment trends
Checkout Process → Form fills, address input, payment selection
Transaction Completion → Purchase success or failure
Using Google Analytics funnel reports, these insights help in refining the e-commerce experience.

3. Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Integration
Google Analytics is configured to capture real-time data from GTM. The TSD.xlsx (Technical Specification Document) outlines event structures, GA parameters, and data layer variables.

GA4 Configuration
Enhanced E-Commerce Reporting enabled.
Custom Dimensions & Metrics set up for user engagement analysis.
Conversion Tracking for high-value actions (e.g., purchase, lead, newsletter_signup).
Attribution Models tested to optimize campaign performance.
GA4 DataLayer Variables
Variable Name	Description	Used In
event_category	Defines the type of interaction	All events
event_label	Descriptive details for events	All events
product_id	Unique identifier for product	View Product, Add to Cart, Purchase
transaction_id	Unique ID for purchases	Purchase event
cart_value	Total value of cart	Checkout
Automated Reporting & Analysis
To improve decision-making, automated reports and dashboards are set up.

1. Google Data Studio / Looker Studio Dashboard
Real-time dashboards for monitoring sales, cart abandonment, and conversion rates.
Segmentation of traffic sources (organic vs paid users).
Product performance analysis (most viewed, highest converting).
2. Power BI / Tableau Integration
Import GA4 event data via BigQuery.
Visualize e-commerce trends (monthly revenue, customer retention).
Identify drop-off points in the checkout funnel.
